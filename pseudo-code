a calculator application using jQuery, Node, and Express!
IMPORTANT: The logic for the calculator needs to be housed on the Server.
Values entered via 2 input fields
Mathematical operation type using a DOM button
Numerical value-mathematical operator type-in an object
Sent to the server via a POST request

Object leaves Client like this:
{
   x: 3,
   y: 4,
   type: "Add"
}
--
Server receives
create logic to compute the numbers in 1 of 4 different ways
ajax
what url
routing
1 route with 4 ops
or
4 ops with 1 route

Server should be able to handle (1) addition, (2) subtraction, (3) multiplication, and (4) division
Mathematical operation is determined, sent back to be displayed on the DOM
Include clear button that resets

HARD MODE
Convert the input fields for the two values to buttons. This experience would allow the user to
click on a numerical button
click on a mathematical operator
click on a numerical button
click on an equal button that sends all of the information to the server
PRO MODE
Style the whole experience using Bootstrap to resemble the design of a physical calculator. Then, include decimal points in your number logic. Finally, convert your logic to have the Client handle which mathematical operation is run. Once it determines this, it will use that to change the URL or the POST request to pair with a Server route that handles that type of mathematical operation.

For example, the Client code might look like this
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "/division",
    success: function(data){
       //something here
    }
});
and the Server code would have something like
router.post('/division', function(req, res){
  //some code here
});
